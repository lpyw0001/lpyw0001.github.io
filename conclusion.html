					<h1>Concluding Remarks <br />

				</header>

				<p>In summary, this project analyses Mastercard's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The main goals
					analysed include zero hunger, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, sustainable cities
					and communities, partnerships and climate change, and through this analysis we can see that
					Mastercard is closely linked to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
					(SDGs), contributing to the eradication of poverty, the promotion of economic and social development
					and the protection of the environment, and that the measures taken by the company are effective and
					worthy of replication by other companies working together to achieve the UN SDGs.</p>

				<p>In further analysis, it was found that Mastercard needs to take steps to mitigate climate change and
					ensure not only climate-related initiatives but also a broader development strategy for long-term
					success. Mastercard's sustainability commitment includes reducing its carbon footprint in its
					business and giving consumers the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, for example by
					replacing plastic cards with environmentally friendly materials. Environmental issues are very
					important in today's society as they can be very damaging to many sectors, with climate
					deterioration endangering food security, human health, economic development, etc. For this reason we
					propose the use of economic incentives to encourage investors to protect the environment, as the
					economic effect is the most important for investors. As well as putting pressure on governments to
					use financial instruments to invest in carbon capture or technological improvements, etc., only if
					governments take effective measures can society as a whole respond in a positive and orderly manner.
