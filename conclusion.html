				<p>In summary, this project analyses Mastercard's actions towards addressing the sustainable development
					goals.

					The goals analysed include zero hunger, gender equality, decent work and economic growth,
					sustainable cities
					and communities and partnerships. However, the primary goal focused on was mitigation strategies
					towards climate change.

					From the analysis performed, it was found Mastercards vision to create a sustainable digital economy
					can complement the United Nation's goals.
					Mastercard have several effective initiatives in place working towards the accomplishment of goal
					13, however to stay ahead of future regulatory changes, mitigate the consequences of inaction
					against climate chant and benefit the company's bottom-line long-term, Mastercard should supplement
					these.


					A simple strategy is to be transparent about emissions reduction opposed to the purchase of credits.
					To complement this strategy Mastercard should provide capital investments in carbon removal
					technology, as this strategy is less risky than the proposed political pressure ultimatum, but can
					still achieve widespread positive impacts. This strategy also requires less business deviation than
					incentivisation towards a shared economy.
