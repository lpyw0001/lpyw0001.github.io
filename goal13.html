					<h1>Goal 13 <br />
					</h1>
					<h3>"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"</h3>
				</header>

				<p>According to a recent statement from the United Nations,</p>
				<blockquote>“Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national
					economies and affecting lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather
					events are becoming more extreme… Saving lives and livelihoods requires urgent action to address
					both the pandemic and the climate emergency.” (United Nations, 2021)</blockquote>
				<p>Climate change has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of
					capital invested in other developmental programs. Thus, taking steps
					to mitigate climate change is required to ensure the long-term success of climate
					related initiatives and a broader range of developmental strategies. Further to this,
					according to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP): </p>
				<blockquote>“Climate change resulting from human activity is affecting our relationship with our
					environment and presents an urgent, significant and growing threat to health worldwide” (RACGP,
					2021)</blockquote>
				<p>Between the priceless planet initiative and a commitment to net zero emissions Mastercard have
					demonstrated strong support towards their employee health and wellbeing, and developing sustainable practices. These initiatives are
					reviewed in detail below. </p>
				<h2>Priceless Planet Coalition</h2>

				<p>Higgs (2014) in her book “Collision Course: Endless Growth on a Finite Planet” unpacks the
					complexities of pursuing relentless economic growth and the potential ramifications for the planet.
					Mastercard
					recognises this complex relationship and late last year launched the Priceless Planet Coalition,
					with the goal to restore 100
					million trees by 2025. Trees act as a natural method of carbon capture. Since forming,
					the coalition now consists of 60 partners.</p>

				<p>Planting trees may often be seen as a “be-all and end-all” solution to climate change, however trees
					can be a natural heat trap, further exacerbating the global warming issue
					(Marshall, 2020). Thus, the location the trees are planted will be pivotal to the program’s success.
					Suppporting this, Kimbrough (2021) concluded that trees planted in
					locations where they are not usually grown, can do more harm than good in terms of carbon
					capture/release.
					To remedy this, Mastercard have enlisted climate experts
					to examine the ideal locations to plant that have the greatest positive impact
					towards the climate, the community and biodiversity. Australia is one of the initial locations for
					reforestation efforts, with forests destroyed by recent bushfires (external factor) and an estimated
					900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This amount is almost twice
					Australia’s total yearly emissions (Chow, 2020). The remaining two locations for initial works are
					Kenya (Makueni County) and Brazil (Amazon and Atlantic forests). </p>

				<p>The collaborative initiative, driven by consumers, financial institutions, merchants, and cities
					serves a few key roles:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Inspire collective action</b></li>
					<p>Mastercard have effectively utilised their network effect, to help empower their 3 billion
						consumer and corporate cardholders to take action to mitigate climate change. They provided a
						platform for individuals or companies to donate to the initiative. They have collaborated with
						several companies to allow rewards points to be redeemed for trees. In addition, Mastercard
						collaborated with Doconomy, to develop a platform for individuals to calculate and take
						accountability for their carbon footprint. </p>
					<div class="box">
						<p>As shown in a recent survey, 58 percent of consumers are more aware of their
							environmental impact, and 85 percent ready to take personal action this year (Mastercard
							Newsroom, 2021). </p>
					</div>
					<p>The partnership allows for Mastercard transactions to be directly translated to their
						environmental impact (Doconomy, 2021). This initiative aligns with a general increase in
						consumer interest and concern around their environmental impact and provides them a quantitative
						assessment. This increased education may help to inspire further collective action. Moreover,
						the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dangers of a rapid spread of misinformation
						(Moshirnia, 2021), thus Mastercard’s educational efforts may help to reduce further spread of
						misinformation in relation to climate change, adding further merit to their collaboration.
					</p>
					<li><b>Reduce the risk and severity of the consequences associated with climate change inaction</b>
					</li>
					<p>Through the tree restoration efforts.</p>

				</ol>

				<p>In relation to the coalition’s success and merits, a recent study published in Springer
					Nature found that nature-based solutions to addressing climate change can be effective when they
					have a clear long-term focus and are coupled with other methods (Girardin et al., 2021). On this
					basis the initiative has merit provided it is not a standalone program. In addition, the initial
					groundwork appears promising but with tree planting works only commencing this year the program’s
					long-term success will require review a later stage. Finally, Mastercard have effectively used the
					“100 million” number to capture public attention and gain traction, however going forward the focus
					should be less on the number of trees planted and migrate to keeping the trees alive and healthy
					long-term. </p>

				<h2>Commitment to Net Zero Emissions</h2>
				<p>Mastercard have a public commitment to be carbon neutral in 2021 and net zero emissions by 2050
					(Mastercard Incorporated, 2020). To help accomplish this, all Mastercard’s owned buildings are
					certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This is a great starting
					point, however ‘certified’ is the minimum requirement, Mastercard should endeavour to accrue more
					points and work towards the gold or platinum certification (LEED, 2021). As part of accruing
					addition points Mastercard could investigate the role green hydrogen can play (Ewing, Israel, Jutt,
					Talebian, & Stepanik, 2020). Further efforts to achieve net zero emissions include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the use of 100%
						renewable energy</li>
					<li>aiming for 100% recycling of electronic waste</li>
					<li>utilising science-based targets</li>
					<li>issuing a $600M sustainability bond to finance the transition to net zero</li>

					<li>engaging suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along their complete supply chain</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Quantitatively, Mastercard found that their suppliers accounted for 70% of the total footprint, thus
					this initiative to actively engage with suppliers could prove effective, and can be verified by
					futures emissions data (Mastercard Incorporated,
					2020). Their
					actions to date have measurably reduced greenhouse-gases as depicted in the following figure:</p>

				<div class="image">
					<figure>
						<img src="images/goal13-01.jpg" alt="" />
						<figcaption><i>Mastercard's scope 1,2 & 3 emissions (Mastercard Incorporated, 2021)</i>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>

				<p>In relation to the above figures, however, the 2020 and 2021 figures should be updated to include the
					emissions that are resultant from employees working remotely/from home that should be directly
					attributed back to Mastercard. Thus, the emissions reduction in 2020 may not be entirely indicative
					of the ‘true’ emissions reduction if these additional emissions are not quantified. </p>
				<p>As a further method to achieve this net zero commitment, Mastercard have coupled executive
					compensation with the achievement of carbon neutrality in 2021. According to a recent report by PwC,
					this practice is becoming increasingly common, but quantitative data to evaluate its effectiveness
					is limited, as it is a relatively new practice (O’Connor, Harris, & Gosling, 2021). Mastercard have
					evidently overcome any backlash this move generated internally. Whilst this provides a
					tangible incentive, Mastercard needs to ensure appropriately calibrated requirements and ensure the
					broad long-term goal is not lost in distorted short-term incentives.</p>

				<p>Critical to Mastercard’s commitment is the word ‘net’ in net zero emissions. The implication here is
					whether, from a practical standpoint, an indefinite quantity of carbon emissions can be offset. This
					means, that reporting only ‘net’ emissions can be misleading and inadequate.
					Rather, the emissions should be in two distinct categories, that of negative emissions, and
					emissions reduction (McLaren, 2019). Negative emissions technology is currently an unproven
					technology, and some proposed geoengineering methods, to inject sulphuric acid into the
					stratosphere, have an associated higher risk and ethical concerns (Dyke, Watson, & Knorr, 2021).
					Thus, to achieve their goal
					Mastercard will likely be required to reduce emissions further as opposed to relying on credits and
					carbon removal strategies. Going
					forward, to demonstrate accountability, Mastercard should clearly delineate the net change in each
					of these two distinct categories. This reporting change will likely appease shareholders given
					“increasing evidence in the academic literature that sustainability has a positive impact on the
					bottom line and shareholder value” (O’Connor et al., 2021).</p>
