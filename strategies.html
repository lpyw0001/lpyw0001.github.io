				<h2>Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
				<p>
					Mastercard formed a partnership with the World Food Programme (WFP) in 2012, with the partnership
					still ongoing to this day. As part of this partnership, alongside local non-profit organisations,
					they committed to provide 100 million school meals. The goal was achieved in its desired 2-year
					timeframe, with 107 million meals provided (Mastercard Incorporated, 2019). The
					initiative also has a positive flow on effect, reducing
					poverty (goal 1) and enhancing education (goal 4). The provision of a school meal is often the
					difference between working in the fields/at home, or attending school, and
					hence the educational benefit. This aids in developing self-sufficiency
					amongst communities. A cost-benefit analysis into school feeding programs found for every US $1
					invested, the economic return is US $6.2 (Kolesova & Moataz, 2018). Growing the economy results in
					an indirect long-term benefit to Mastercard if this leads to a growth in the digital economy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Historically, one factor behind food shortages is not the lack of food itself, but rather war and
					conflict. The relationship between food insecurity and conflict is highly complex; food shortages
					can cause conflict but by the same token conflict can cause food shortages, and an unrelenting cycle
					can result (Messer & Cohen, 2015). Thus, the school meals provided may have a further flow on effect
					of reduced conflict when factoring in the increased education levels and reduced food shortage. Future
					works by the company in relation to goal 2 should also consider steps towards reducing food wastage.
					Concluding remarks are that the highly successful nature of the program can be partially
					attributed to the effective use	of partnerships, which should be considered when developing future initiatives.
				</p>

				<h2>Goal 5: Gender Equality</h2>
				<p>
					Mastercard have a commitment to gender equality both internally, and externally. In 2018, the
					company
					reported women earnt $0.996 for every $1.00 earnt by men. In 2019, this figure was women
					earning $1.00 for every $1.00 earnt by men, and this ratio has been maintained ever since. 
					In addition, as a technology company Mastercard plays a role in helping to
					address the highly prevalent gender inequality and stigma within the science, technology,
					engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sector. They implemented the successful Girls4Tech program,
					having reached 1 million 8- to 16-year-olds since commencing in 2014, with the intent to encourage
					STEM uptake and consider it as a career avenue (Mastercard Incorporated, 2020).
				</p>
				<p>
					Collectively these initiatives demonstrate that Mastercard has followed through on their proposals,
					with actions not just the intent. The benefit to the company is developing a stronger reputation as
					an equal opportunity employer and thus more likely to attract stronger candidates when
					recruiting.
				</p>

				<h2>Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
				<p>Globally, cities represent the largest source of gross-domestic product (GDP) and ergo a large source
					of revenue for Mastercard. The City Possibly program launched by Mastercard strives to develop
					“sustainable urban futures” (City Possible, 2021). The program has 220 city members and provides a
					streamlined method for collaboration between public companies, private companies, academics, and
					communities. The merit of the program is the long-term focus, adopting a grounds-up approach to
					strive for meaningful change. </p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Goal 17: partnerships</h2>
				<p>Mastercard collaboratively launched data.org. This
					platform utilises their expertise and datasets to make them more accessible to non-profit,
					government and civic organisations. The intent is for the organisations to use the datasets for
					social impact. Data-driven decisions can provide companies with a competitive advantage (Arunachalam
					& Kumar, 2018). Having this insight accessible to aid in making informed decisions has widescale
					benefits in a diverse spread of government and non-profit organisations. The advantage to Mastercard
					is the relationships formed and an increase in goodwill.</p>
