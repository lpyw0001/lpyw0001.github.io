								<p>Mastercard is committed to providing consumers around the world with a more convenient and efficient financial payments environment. Their mission is to promote an inclusive digital economy by making transactions secure, simple, smart, and convenient for everyone, everywhere. They believe in an interconnected world and are committed to environmental and social responsibility, with their core values of ethical, responsible, and humane behaviour being directly related to the continued success of the business.</p>
								<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call on all countries to take action to protect the planet while promoting economic prosperity. The goals state that poverty eradication must go hand in hand with several strategies. These include promoting economic growth, meeting social needs in education, health, social protection and employment opportunities, curbing climate change and protecting the environment. Governments, consumers, public, and private businesses are all required to collaborate to achieve the goals, and create a better environment for all to thrive.</p>
								<p>From Mastercard's core philosophy, we can see that it is closely linked to the success of the SDGs, developing a sustainable digital economy can go hand in hand to contributing to the eradication of poverty, the promotion of economic and social development and the protection of the environment. Mastercardâ€™s current strategies in relation to the achievement of these goals will be analysed, with a close focus on their actions to mitigate climate change. Recommendations for the company going forward will also be presented. </p>
