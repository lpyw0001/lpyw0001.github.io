					<h1>Recommendations <br />
					</h1>

				</header>

				<p>Climate change is the aftermath of two competing agendas, the pursuit of economic growth coupled with
					a general disregard of the environmental and resource challenges this pursuit requires (Wolf, 2012).
					Successfully finding the middle ground between these two visions is a complex political,
					technological challenge, without even factoring in the time pressure. Climate change has direct
					ramifications on numerous sectors: water, wildlife, agriculture, human health, energy, and
					transportation, amongst others (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2019). This complex
					interrelationship is the primary reason for focusing on goal 13 and examining the role Mastercard
					can play in developing additional strategies to complement their current array of initiatives.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Modelling by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found inaction towards
					climate change would have direct economic impacts, causing a decline
					in GDP (OECD, 2015). A weak economy would mean a decrease in revenue for Mastercard due to a
					corresponding reduction in revenue collected from switching and volume fees. Moreover, a growing
					number of investors review the climate related financial disclosures provided by companies and use
					them to evaluate investment decisions. Thus, there is an additional financial incentive for the
					pursuit of goal 13, to attract additional investors, and ceteris paribus increase the share price
					further.</p>

				<h2>Carbon removal technology</h2>
				<p>To complement the priceless planet initiative already in place,
					it is recommended for Mastercard to invest in carbon removal technology. These
					technologies can accelerate
					decarbonization efforts. To limiting global warming to a 1.5°C increase, 10 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> is required to be removed each year till 2050. Furthermore, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned
					there is a 20% chance that temperature could rise above 1.5°C as early as 2024 (United Nations
					Environment Programme, n.d.). Therefore, technological advancement alongside the traditional tree
					restorations is needed to maximize carbon emission removal.</p>

				<div class="image left"><img src="images/recommendations-02.jpg" alt="" /></div>

				<p>By implementing this strategy, Mastercard can utilize the ‘domino effect’ highly prevalent in the
					technology sector. This is because Mastercard is relatively indistinguishable from its largest
					competitor, Visa, when one company introduces a feature or service, the other often follows. Hence,
					Mastercard will be able to directly challenge its competitors to follow in their footsteps. </p>

				<p>Some potential carbon removal technologies available include bioenergy with carbon capture and direct
					air
					capture (DIA)(Bistline & Blanford, 2021). DIA is currently the most promising; this method
					captures CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and stores it underground (WRI, n.d.). Compared to
					bioenergy with
					carbon capture, DIA has a higher sequestration efficiency (Cuffari, 2021). Currently
					it can capture about 13,000 metric tons (Hiar,2021). A
					limiting factor is the cost, ranging from $250-$600 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> captured
					(Lebling, McQueen, Pisciotta & Wilcox, 2021). However, with government incentives and funding, and,
					benefitting from technological spill-over effects, this cost can be reduced (International Energy
					Agency, 2020). </p>

				<p>The carbon removal industry is still in relatively infancy, and whilst not a first mover, as an early
					investor Mastercard can benefit from the research performed so far and profit from future
					breakthroughs by investing capital. Doing so would help Mastercard take a step ahead of their
					direct competitors and actively contribute to carbon emissions removal. </p>

				<h2>Political pressure</h2>
				<p>Another strategy Mastercard can implement is to place political pressure on governments that
					put minimal effort into climate change initiatives. This political pressure could come in the form
					of a threat to not process any credit card transactions for a short timeframe if certain climate
					change commitments are
					not made. This strategy would
					almost certainly
					encounter significant backlash from the public, businesses, and the government. This is due to both
					the
					inconvenience it would cause and the potential revenue losses for businesses. Thus, Mastercard
					would have no intent to follow through, due to the scope of possible repercussions. </p>
					<p>The intent
					behind the strategy is that as per the United Nations, governments play a vital role in driving a
					systemic shift to addressing climate change (United Nations [UN], n.d.). Some actions governments
					could be required to commit to include the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, and quantifying and
					confronting climate associated risks, among others. In exchange for meeting these commitments
					Mastercard can offer to invest in long-term energy storage projects locally in that country, which
					aids in creating a low-carbon economy as consumption continues to increase (Climate Investment
					Funds, 2021). </p>

				<h2>Renewable energy</h2>
				<p>Cambridge University Press published a book that claims,
					<blockquote>“Renewable energy sources play a role in
						providing energy services in a sustainable manner and, in particular, in mitigating climate
						change”
						(Edenhofer et al., 2011).</blockquote>
					Mastercard’s largest energy contributor are their data centres (Mastercard Incorporated, 2020).
					Whilst Mastercard claims 100% renewable energy status, currently 88.5% of this
					is through the purchase of credits. To reduce reliance on these credits, and simultaneously
					contribute to goal 13 Mastercard could provide additional on-site renewable energy generation and
					storage at these data centres. The initial capital outlay would only be modest, and provides
					environmental benefits, and future cash flows from the generated electricity. Mastercard could also invest capital in new large-scale energy storage projects, such as green hydrogen, batteries, and compressed air energy storage systems, that have
					attached carbon dioxide capture systems (Zeynalian, Hajialirezaei, Razmi, & Torabi, 2020). As an
					early investor in new energy storage projects, Mastercard has the potential to generate higher
					returns from the investment. Furthermore, renewable energy sources are now cheaper than fossil fuels
					which can help Mastercard cut costs in the long-run (International renewable energy agency
					[IREA], 2021). Another
					factor that favours this recommendation is the public funding and financial incentives for renewable
					energy that the U.S Governments have laid out (Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). Transitioning
					to using more renewable energy sources can drive further economic growth as it
					gives more employment opportunities and increased human welfare (IREA, 2016) which benefits
					Mastercard in the long run. </p>

							</tr>

				<h2>Shared Economy</h2>
				<p>A final strategy Mastercard can implement is to incentivise a transition to a shared economy.
					Precise definitions of a shared economy vary; however, the common theme is the sharing of both goods
					and services, facilitated via a digital platform (Fors, Inutsuka, & Orito, 2021). For example, Uber
					and Airbnb. The value of this platform is the ability to increase resource efficiency, alter consumption habits, have less ownership, and less idle capacity, and therefore reduced
					environmental impacts and emissions (Perez-Perez, Benito-Osorio, Garcia-Moreno, &
					Martinez-Fernandez, 2021). An up-and-coming example of this is reduced car ownership as vehicles
					gradually become more autonomous. Mastercard could utilise their existing network infrastructure to
					partner with an autonomous vehicle company and incentivise, for example short-term discount, the use
					of the platform. Mastercard would then generate revenue from all transactions processed as part of
					the partnership.</p>
