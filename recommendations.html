					<h1>Recommendations <br />
					</h1>

				</header>

				<p>Climate change is the aftermath of two competing agendas, the pursuit of economic growth coupled with
					a general disregard of the environmental and resource challenges this pursuit requires (Wolf, 2012).
					Successfully finding the middle ground between these two visions is a complex political,
					technological challenge, without even factoring in the time pressure. Climate change has direct
					ramifications on numerous sectors: water, wildlife, agriculture, human health, energy, and
					transportation, amongst others (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2019). This complex
					interrelationship, and the impact climate change can have on the accomplishment of other sustainable
					development goals is the primary reason for focusing on goal 13 and examining the role Mastercard
					can play in developing additional strategies to complement their current array of initiatives.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/recommendations-01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<i>Inaction towards climate change impact on GDP (OECD, 2015)</i>
				<p>Modelling by OECD found inaction towards climate change would have direct economic impacts, a decline
					in GDP (OECD, 2015). A weak economy would likely mean a decrease in revenue for Mastercard due to a
					corresponding reduction in revenue collected from switching and volume fees. Moreover, a growing
					number of investors review the climate related financial disclosures provided by companies and use a
					means to evaluate investment decision. Thus, there is an additional financial incentive for the
					pursuit of goal 13, to attract additional investors, and ceteris paribus increase the share price
					further.</p>

				<h2>Carbon removal technology</h2>
				<p>Aside from the priceless planet initiative in place to help with carbon removal from the environment,
					it is recommended for Mastercard to invest in Carbon removal technology. This is because these
					technologies are considered as an active way for carbon emissions removal which can accelerate
					decarbonization efforts. Based on the Paris Agreement, to avoid alarming global warming, global
					temperature must be kept to a 1.5-degree increase (World Resources Institute [WRI], n.d.). WRI
					further stated that to achieve this goal, it needs to remove 10 Gt CO2 per year and 20 Gt CO2 per
					year by 2050 and 2100 respectively. Furthermore, World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned that
					there is a 20% chance that temperature could rise above 1.5% as early as 2024 (United Nations
					Environment Programme, n.d.). Therefore, technological advancement alongside the traditional tree
					restorations is needed to maximize carbon emission removal.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/recommendations-02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>By implementing this strategy, Mastercard can utilize the ‘domino effect’ highly prevalent in the
					technology sector. This is because Mastercard is relatively indistinguishable from its largest
					competitor, Visa, when one company introduces a feature or service, the other often follows. Hence,
					Mastercard will be able to directly challenge its competitors to follow in their footsteps. There
					are many carbon technologies available including bioenergy with carbon capture and direct air
					capture (Bistline & Blanford, 2021). Direct air capture is currently the most promising, this method
					captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it underground (WRI, n.d.). Compared to bioenergy with
					carbon capture, direct air capture has a higher sequestration efficiency (Cuffari, 2021). One of the
					most significant plants for this technology, can capture about 13,000 metric tons (Hiar,2021). One
					current limiting factor is the cost, currently ranging from $250-$600 per tonne of CO2 captured
					(Lebling, McQueen, Pisciotta & Wilcox, 2021). However, with government incentives and funding, and,
					benefitting from technological spill-over effects, the cost can be reduced (International Energy
					Agency, 2020). </p>
				<p>The carbon removal industry is still in relatively infancy, and whilst not a first mover, as an early
					investor Mastercard can benefit from the research performed so far and profit from future
					breakthroughs by investing capital. Doing so would help Mastercard to take a step ahead of their
					direct competitors and actively contribute to carbon emissions removal. </p>

				<h2>Political pressure</h2>
				<p>Another strategy that Mastercard could implement is to place political pressure on governments that
					put minimal effort into climate change initiatives. This political pressure could come in the form
					of a threat to not process any credit card transactions if certain climate change commitments are
					not made. Whilst this strategy may result in Mastercard seen as bold and forward acting, it would
					encounter significant backlash from the public, businesses, and the government, due to A) the
					inconvenience it would cause and B) the potential revenue loss for businesses. Thus, Mastercard
					would have no intent to follow through, due to the scope of possible repercussions. The intent
					behind the strategy is that as per the United Nations, governments play a vital role in driving a
					systemic shift to addressing climate change (United Nations [UN], n.d.). Some actions governments
					could be required to commit to include the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, and quantifying and
					confronting climate associated risks, among others. In exchange for meeting these commitments
					Mastercard can offer to invest in long-term energy storage projects locally in that country, which
					aids in creating a low-carbon economy as consumption continues to increase (Climate Investment
					Funds, 2021). </p>

				<h2>Renewable energy</h2>
				<p>Cambridge University Press published a book that claims, “Renewable energy sources play a role in
					providing energy services in a sustainable manner and, in particular, in mitigating climate change”
					(Edenhofer et al., 2011). Mastercard’s largest energy contributor are their data centres (2020
					report). Mastercard currently claims 100% renewable energy status, however currently 88.5% of these
					is through the purchase of credits. Hence to reduce reliance on these credits, and simultaneously
					contribute to goal 13 Mastercard could provide additional on-site renewable energy generation and
					storage at these data centres. The initial capital outlay would only be modest, and provides
					environmental benefits, and future cash flows from the generated electricity. In addition to
					providing on-site generation, Mastercard could invest capital in new large-scale energy storage
					projects, such as green hydrogen, batteries, and compressed air energy storage systems, that have
					attached carbon dioxide capture systems (Zeynalian, Hajialirezaei, Razmi, & Torabi, 2020). As an
					early investor in new energy storage projects, Mastercard has the potential to generate higher
					returns from the investment. Furthermore, renewable energy sources are now cheaper than fossil fuels
					which can help Mastercard cut their costs in the long run (International renewable energy agency
					[IREA], 2021), with costs of new solar projects ~85% of their prior cost (Masterson, 2021). Another
					factor that favours this recommendation is the public funding and financial incentives for renewable
					energy that the U.S Governments have laid out (Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). By
					transitioning to using more renewable energy sources, it could drive further economic growth as it
					gives more employment opportunities and increase human welfare (IREA, 2016) which benefits
					Mastercard in the long run. Given the positive trend in political, technological factors and
					potential economic benefits, Mastercard is recommended to start and continue investing in more
					renewable energy sources for its data centres and slowly apply it to their other departments. </p>

				<h2>Shared Economy</h2>
				<p>A final strategy Mastercard can implement is to incentivise a transition to more of a shared economy.
					Precise definitions of a shared economy vary; however, the common theme is the sharing of both goods
					and services, facilitated via a digital platform (Fors, Inutsuka, & Orito, 2021). For example, Uber
					and Airbnb. The value of this platform is the ability to increase resource efficiency, fundamentally
					alter consumption habits, have less ownership, and less idle capacity, and therefore reduced
					environmental impacts and emissions (Perez-Perez, Benito-Osorio, Garcia-Moreno, &
					Martinez-Fernandez, 2021). An up-and-coming example of this is reduced car ownership as vehicles
					gradually become more autonomous. Mastercard could utilise their existing network infrastructure to
					partner with an autonomous vehicle company and incentivise, for example short-term discount, the use
					of the platform. </p>
